About the project:

This code was taken from one of my assignments in my Databases and Web Interfaces classes at Wellesley. 
A user can search a database (hosted on MySQL) to find more information about a specific movie or actor. 
The database used for this project is meant to mimic that of the well known IMDb, though it doesn't have 
nearly as many movies and actors in it as it was made to service our class and this assignment. The code 
is mainly written in PHP, with some SQL queries as well as HTML for formatting the front-end. 
To see (and play around with) the web interface, please go to cs.wellesley.edu/~sliu4/cs304/wmdb-search.php .
